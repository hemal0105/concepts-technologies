OWASP - Open Web Application Security Project 
    Every year they release important security measures or findidings
    They release OWASP top ten every 4 years (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
      
Spring Security Framework
    Takes care of most of OWASP guidelines and makes application secure
    Provides framework and sugesstions for secure application

Steps for Spring Security setup
    go to start.spring.io
    select maven, spring boot latest version, add artifact group and name
    select packaging as jar and java version
    select add dependencies and add "Spring Web", "Spring Boot DevTools", "Spring Security"
    select Generate and it will download a zip
    exctract zip and open it in IntelliJ
    Run the Spring boot project in IntelliJ
    when any RestController api is called it will be prompted with login form
    User name is "user" and pwd would be shown in logs during app startup
    pwd is for development only for single user
    we can logout the seesion with /logout endpoint
    username and pwd can be set from application.properties for super user but actual user's creds can be fetched from DB

Spring Security internals
    all RestController are internally converted to servlet 
    Before servlet gets called, there are DispatcherServlet (front Controller)
    Even before servlet, there are Filters and FilterChain
    Spring Security, add its own Filter Auth internally
    Under developer tools of browser it can be seen that under cookie it adds JSESSIONID with alphanum id as value

CSRF - Cross-ste Request Forgery
    Some malicious website cant exctact session ids and call APIs with it due to CSRF
    spring security by default allows HTTP GET
    spring security generates CSRF token internally
        it can be viewed in browser's view page source with _csrf hidden tag
        it can be get from HTTPServletRequest attributes
    csrf token is needed to perform PUT, POST, DELETE HTTP methods
    we can also disable CSRF completely if everytime new session is generated or same site stricness is enabled
